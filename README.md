# Let's build a simple database => (https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/)[DB tutorial]

this is a side project I created to understand how a database works. As the project says in their website, this is a sqlite clone from scratch built in C.

## Part 1 - Introduction and setting up the REPL

Quoting the first line of the website:
> as a web developer, I use relational databases every day at my job, but they're a black box to me.

this refers to the fact that he doesn't understand how they work. I can relate as I work with different databases and yet I don't fully understand how to they work.

In this project I believe I can learn at least the basic of their functionality and purpose.
